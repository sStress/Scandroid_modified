Fly Me to the Moon, 
And let me play among the stars. 
Let me see what spring is like, 
On Jupiter and Mars. 
In other words, hold my hand, 
In other words, darling kiss me. 

Fill my heart with song, 

And let me sing forever more, 
You are all I long for, 
All I worship and adore, 
In other words, please be true, 
In other words, I love you.
