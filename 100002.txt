The songs they're playin' that we both romanced to, 
Those lovely songs we stayed up late and danced to, 
They taught me where my heart belongs, 
These are the songs I love! 

The tender melodies we often sighed to, 
That special one we said good-bye and cried to, 
Because they righted all the wrongs, 
These are the songs I love! 

The happy rhymes, the underscored, 
The happy time when we found spring together. 

The pretty themes, that underscored the pretty dreams, 
That make us cling together! 

These songs we'll call our own and face the years with, 
We'll face the laughter, yes, and face the tears with, 
They'll help us through the rain and shine, 
These songs I love because these songs are yours and mine!
