Moon River, wider than a mile, 
I'm crossing you in style, some day, 
Oh dream maker, you heart breaker, 
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way, 
Two drifters, off to see the world, 
There's such a lot of world to see, 
We're after the same rainbows end, 
Waitin' ‘round the bend, 
My Huckleberry friend, 
Moon River, and me! 

Moon River, wider than a mile, 
I'm crossing you in style, some day . . . 

Two drifters, off to see the world, 
There's such a lot of world to see, 
We're after the same rainbows end, 
Waitin' ‘round the bend, 
My Huckleberry friend, 
Moon River, and me! 

Moon River, and me . . .
